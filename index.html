        <h2>THE MUSIC</h2>
        <h4>IT GROOVES YOU</h4>
        <p>
          During their “funky” years, the Bar-Kays, an American rhythm and
          blues, soul, and funk band, composed an excellent perspective song
          titled “Attitude”. What is a perspective song? It’s a song that may
          make you get up and bop, but the words will stay with you. Here are
          just a few lines of that song’s lyrics.
        </p>
        <div class="col-md-10" id="focus">
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">

                >attitude</span
              >
              is what describes you. What you want to be.
            </li>
            <li>It just may not be what the people see.</li>
            <li>It`s up to your attitude to show the real you.</li>
            <li>Because it's in your eyes; that`s where the truth resides.</li>
            <li><b>Here come the changes!</b></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          “Your attitude is what describes you.” An unusual but quite memorable
          <span
            style="color: red"
            title="a musical unforgettable beat or phrase in a song that catches your attention"
            >hook</span
          >. Nothing truly indicates your attitude louder than your actions
          along with your words. That said, how a person feels may be completely
          different then their actions portray. Just because someone
          <i>does</i> or <i>says</i> nice things doesn’t necessarily mean they
          are a nice person. Today’s message from God’s Word demonstrates how
          some early Christians didn’t feel their attitudes had any connection
          to their Christian walk.

        <h2>MESSAGE</h2>
        <h4>IT MYSTIFIES YOU</h4>
        <p>
          Imagine you're enjoying a nice dinner with family and close friends.
          Some of those friends are very important people. As on prior
          occasions, everyone is having a good time. Then suddenly people you’ve
          never seen before walk in. Abruptly, the most admired person at your
          table gets up, disassociating himself with you and your companions to
          join these newcomers at another table. You find that odd, but then
          another prominent person at your table removes himself as well.
          Getting strange, right? But it doesn’t stop there. Others get up,
          making you and the other remaining people at your table feel as though
          you no longer exist to them. This is particularly painful because
          you’ve thought of these people as good friends and part of a
          close-knit Christian fellowship.<br /><br />
          Has this or something similar ever happened to you? Let's cruise along
          and see what God's Word says about such behavior.

          >
          wanting to kill Jesus might want to kill him too. Other than that,
          they were good friends. In the second scripture passage above, the
          apostle Paul is upset with Peter. If expressed in twenty-first century
          language, Paul might have said something like the following.<br /><br />
          “Yo, Bro, what are you doing? You of all people should know better
          than to act like this, especially towards our new Christian believers.
          Jesus trusted you with His people in spite of your personal faults.
          You were an ordinary fisherman, quick to speak and not always wise
          with your words, including being quick to deny our Lord when trouble
          came. Yet Jesus chose you as one of His closest confidants. Now you
          are disrespecting people because they are not Jewish by birth as we
          are. What’s wrong with you? Peter, you know better!”<br /><br />
          The apostle Peter was one of the early Christian community's most
          influential leaders. But on this occasion, his behavior was way out of
          line. Paul had to call Peter out because as part of “the elect of
          God,” he most definitely was not putting on “tender mercies” or
          “kindness.” Peter had enjoyed eating with these people many times
          before. So what was the problem now?<br /><br />
          Surprisingly , the above passage from Galatians makes clear that Peter
          acted as he did because he was “afraid of the Jews.” Definitely not
          the Peter we know who jumped from the boat to walk on water, blurted
          out both truth and denial of Jesus, was first to race to the tomb when
          told Jesus was alive, preached so powerfully that thousands were
          saved, and did so many impressive miracles. But “afraid of the Jews”
          doesn’t necessarily mean Peter was frightened. It means Peter was
          being true to Peter. He was intimidated. These friends of
          <span style="color: red" title="Jesus’ brother (Matthew 13:55)"
            >James</span
          >
          may have been like some of ours—you know, the ones we try to impress.
          The ones we feel have influence or power. All Peter knew was that he
          didn’t want James’s friends to see him associating with Gentile
          believers whom these influential Jewish church leaders considered
          unworthy of their company.<br /><br />
          Before we address why Paul was so heated that he felt compelled to
          publicly reprimand Peter, let's take a brief look at the backstory of
          both Peter and Paul. Both men had their problems. Peter, one of the
          greatest early preachers of the gospel, had led many to become
          followers of Christ. But we’ve already talked about his faults. Paul
          became the first great missionary evangelist and church planter, a man
          who wrote a sizeable percentage of the New Testament. But he started
          out as a tormenter and even murderer of early Jewish Christians for
          their faith in Jesus Christ. You may wonder what in the world Jesus
          saw in these men, but they became the two greatest preachers of the
          gospel mentioned in the New Testament.<br /><br />
          So exactly what is the gospel? There are so many beautiful and
          detailed explanations that I've created my own from my personal
          studies about Jesus Christ. The gospel is the best news about a life
          of solidarity. It’s educating yourself and valuing all the
          scripture-based facts or events on how to survive in a hurting,
          pain-filled world. It’s dedicating every day to sharing that
          unconditional love freely given to all by Jesus Christ.<br /><br />
          Paul was not only livid with Peter's attitude but angry at what was
          happening to his trusted friend Barnabas, who had helped him get
          started in ministry. Now Barnabas was participating in this
          un-Christlike legalism. When the other Jewish Christians saw how their
          leaders were behaving towards the Gentile
          <span
            style="color: red"
            title="a person changing / adopting different religious beliefs"
            >converts</span
          >, they too began acting hypocritically. Not good!<br /><br />
          In his early days as leader of the Jerusalem church, Peter had
          originally struggled with the concept that pagan Gentiles could become
          Christians as well as God`s chosen people, the Jews. But Peter had
          received a personal vision from God, making clear that God accepts
          all, both Jews and Gentiles. Once Peter changed his perspective, God
          sent him to a Gentile household to proclaim the gospel, where Peter
          stated:<br /><br />
        </p>
        <div class="col-md-10" id="focus">
          <p>
            I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism but
            accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is
            right. (Acts 10:34-35)
          </p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          From that point, Peter had outwardly welcomed Gentiles as equals. But
          his behavior in Antioch makes clear his heart was not completely
          surrendered to the idea. Just because we are introduced to new
          things—people of different races, cultures, socioeconomic backgrounds,
          etc.—doesn’t mean our old inward attitudes disappear. This is the
          problem with attitudes. They tend to show the real, true you. Peter
          and Barnabas weren’t just experiencing a cultural peer pressure
          moment. This was a terrible leadership decision that caused a domino
          effect of bad behavior. God's Word reminds us:<br /><br />
        </p>
        <div class="col-md-10" id="focus">
          <p>
            Above all else, you must live in a way that brings honor to the good
            news about Christ. (Philippians 1:27a)
          </p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          But Peter's attitude showed no “honor” for the feelings of these
          Gentile Christians. Peter had been down this road before when he'd
          denied knowing Jesus. Though a disciple and close friend of Jesus,
          he’d been afraid of how others would perceive him if he admitted he
          knew Jesus. In the same way, Peter reverted back to his original
          attitude toward non-Jews out of fear of James’s Jewish friends. How
          could this be, considering such behavior toward the Antioch Gentile
          Christians occurred <i>after</i> Peter was filled with the
          <span
            style="color: red"
            title="The Holy Spirit a part of the Trinity &#8211 the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. He is the person that helps believers live a life pattern after Jesus. (Ezekiel 36:27; John 14:26)"
            >Holy Spirit</span
          >
          ? <i>After</i> he became a new person in Christ, as God's Word
          describes: <br /><br />
        </p>
        <div class="col-md-10" id="focus">
          <p>
            I have been crucified with Christ &#8211 it is no longer I who live, but
            Christ lives in me &#8211 and the life which I now live in the flesh I
            live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for
            me. (Galatians 2:20)
          </p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          What is clear here is that being baptized with the Holy Spirit did not
          make Peter perfect. It doesn't make those who proclaim the gospel
          today or any other Christian perfect either. The apostle Paul
          expressed his confidence to the early church . . .<br /><br />
        </p>
        <div class="col-md-10" id="focus">
          <p>
            . . . that you are working together and that you are struggling side
            by side to get others to believe the good news. (Philippians 1:27b)
          </p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          That is what we should be doing as well. Didn't Jesus Christ go out of
          His way, in fact, all the way to the cross, to make all people feel
          loved and wanted? Whether there is little we may have in common or
          agree on with another person, building up Christ’s kingdom is not a
          pick and choose. It’s about spreading the love Christ has for
          everyone. No matter the intention, motive, concern, we are to “have
          this same attitude in yourselves which was in Christ Jesus,”
          (Philippians 2:5). In other words, look to Jesus as our example in
          selfless humility. Let me offer a brief paraphrase of the Bar-Kays'
          impactful lyrics on the importance of attitude. <br /><br />

          should have come to church. The three sisters reseat themselves a few
          rows up. As the pastor starts preaching, one sister falls asleep, one
          sister starts texting, and the third pulls up a game up on her tablet.

          Best reason in the world to go to church is to get a good feeling from
          the Word of God. Making people feel bad is just an added bonus. &#129322; No,
          I’m just messing with you!

            Lord, my desire is to follow you. What has developed in me, does not always represent you. You showed no concern when your reputation was questioned for eating with whom some consider degenerates. I want the same mindset. Lord, I need you to create in me a clean heart. Lower my nose if at any time it goes upward. Correct my eyes if they begin to appear side-eyed. Give my body language an overhaul if it expresses disapproval. When you fix these things. My attitude will be what describes You. Pure, lovely, and honorable. In Jesus Name…Amen
